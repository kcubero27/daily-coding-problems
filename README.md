# Daily Coding Problem

## First steps
In order to run the project locally, you might need to install [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/es/) version. In case you have NVM, you can just run `nvm use`.

To run all the tests, run `npm run test`.

## Technologies
- Jest
- Node.js
- Typescript

## Project structure
Each problem has a folder with it's number. Inside, you will see:
```
index.ts: exports a function called func with all the logic
index.test.ts: minimum tests to pass based on the problem 
```
